# Agent Guidelines

This document describes how automated agents should contribute to this repository.

## In-code Comments

- Begin every new file with a banner comment that states the file path and a concise description of its purpose.
- Include a `Development Plan` section near the top of significant files listing TODO items or design notes.
- Document each exported function or React component with JSDoc style comments describing parameters, return values and side effects.
- Keep inline comments focused on explaining non-obvious logic and update them whenever the code changes.

## Systematic Development

- Review `DEVELOPMENT_NOTES.md`, `assets.md` and other docs before starting work to stay aligned with the overall plan.
- Synchronize code comments with documentation so the entire project evolves cohesively.
- Make small, self-contained commits with clear messages. Avoid bundling unrelated changes.
